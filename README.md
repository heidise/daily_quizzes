# Daily Quizzes - Ongoing personal Java Spring Boot backend + React frontend project

This is an ongoing personal project which is not finished yet. The project will consist of 

- Spring Boot Java backend
- PostgreSQL database
- React frontend

Project is dockerized and can be run using Docker:

- Run the program: `docker-compose up`
  
- You can make API calls to the backend: http://localhost:8080
-> There is only test API call available at the moment: http://localhost:8080/api/hello
    
- Stop containers: `docker-compose down`

The main idea is to practice using:

- IntelliJ IDEA IDE
- Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA 
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
